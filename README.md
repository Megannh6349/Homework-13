##### Homework-13:  Eat-Da-Burger! #####

### About This App

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

### User Story

* AS A user

* I WANT an app where I can log things I want to eat, and then show I've eaten them

* SO I can brag about how many burgers I've consumed while showing off my programming skills

### Important stuff I learned

* Creating package.json
    * The package.json is used for more than dependencies - like defining project properties, description, author & license information, scripts, etc.

* Creating package-lock.json
    The package-lock.json is solely used to lock dependencies to a specific version number.

* Node_Modules/
    * This is how we use Express.

* MySQL basics
    * Had a lot of issues here and learned how to troubleshoot issues I may have
